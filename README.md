- This topic is chosen because customers are experiencing issues accessing mobile banking.

Live Ticket Management:
- Agents can view live tickets within the agent panel.
- Queue managers are responsible for assigning priority tickets to the appropriate agents and ensuring the correct Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are applied.

Priority and SLA Assignment:
- The priority level for the ticket is set to "Emergency" in this example.
- This choice is made because the issue has the potential to significantly impact a section of the business.
- The SLA plan is adjusted, and the ticket is assigned to a top-level technician.
- Note that in some ticketing systems, customers may have the option to set their own SLA plans for their tickets.

Resolution and closting ticket:

- The ticket now appears in the "Closed" section under tickets
